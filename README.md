# Snake-Ladder-Game
This is a nostalgic and memorable Snakes and Ladders game designed with the widely used Python language.
This game offers play areas for 2 to 6 players and you can play with your friends
In this game, there is a roll command that you can use to roll dice and determine your movement path
The final executable file of the game is saved in mine, and running it will take you to the main game
In the user interface file, I also divided the playing field, which is loaded with a gif image, and specified the width and height so that the pieces are placed in the correct house
There is also a dicemove file that includes the random dice movement logic
