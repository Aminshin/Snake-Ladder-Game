# Snake-Ladder-Game
This is a nostalgic and memorable Snakes and Ladders game designed with the widely used Python language.
This game offers playing areas for 2 to 6 people and you can play with your friends.
In this game, there is a roll command that you can use to roll dice and determine your movement path.
The final executable file of the game is saved in mine, and running it will take you to the main game.
In the user interface file, I also divided the playing field, which was loaded with a GIF image, and specified the width and height so that the pieces would be placed in the correct house.
